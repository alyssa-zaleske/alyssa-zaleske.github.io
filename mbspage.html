        <p style="text-align: center;color: #E3B59A;font-size: 1em;">For this assignment I was tasked to create three posters that represented my mind, body, and spirit through multiple images combined to create one image in photoshop. I downloaded over 100 different photos from pxfuel to accomplish this assignment. Through trial and error many of the photos I downloaded did not make the cut. 
            My inspiration came from music. Music is one of the many ways I communicate my feelings, and while listening to these songs I started building my posters in my head.
             For my mind poster I am constantly worried about everything, and I wanted to depict the emotions I feel the most through my image and the song I chose.
              For my body poster, I used the fact that I am expecting as the focus. The pink flowers represent the gender of my baby. 
              I wanted this poster to be elegant and sophisticated. The spirit poster was my favorite to create. 
              It was very difficult creating my body poster because all I could think about was the spirit poster.
               For the spirit poster I incorporated my sign, constellation, and a lion to represent Leo. 
               I used the silhouette as a representation of my love for my fianc√© and the butterflies and a symbol of my grandma. 
               The background resembles the fall and that is when I feel the happiest, so I added that as well.
                When people view these posters, I want them to feel inspired and also hopefully connect with them on their own level. 
                I want them to be mesmerized by how emotional they are.
